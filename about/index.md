About Me
========
I am a software engineer focusing primarily on _Enterprise Applications_ at a [Bangladesh](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bangladesh/)-based company. As part of my job, I heavily rely on _Object-Oriented Design (OOD)_, _Domain-Driven Design (DDD)_, and _Test-Driven Development (TDD)_. At times, I enjoy leafing through my copies of _Enterprise Application Architecture_ and _Implementing Domain-Driven Design_ for inspiration.

I grew up in [Sylhet](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sylhet/) and now live in [Dhaka](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dhaka/).

About this Blog
===============
In this blog, I write about interesting things that I encounter over the course of my work. Usually, my writeups assume an early-stage software engineer audience, with knowledge of basic programming. While covering a topic, I leave as many asides as possible intended to help readers engage with the topic with greater perspective.

**Disclaimer**. The opinions expressed in this blog represent my own and not those of any entity with which I have been, am now, or will be affiliated.
