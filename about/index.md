I am a software engineer at a Bangladesh-based company. _Enterprise Applications_ is my primary interest, and while doing that, I heavily rely on _Object-Oriented Design_, _Domain-Driven Design_, and _Test-Driven Development_.

In this blog I write expository articles on interesting things that I encounter over the course of my work.
